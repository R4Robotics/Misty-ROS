# Misty-ROS
ROS bridge for Misty robot by Misty Robotics

## Set Up
1. Download the misty_description folder, containing the launch files, meshes, and URDF file. 
2. Extract the folder to your workspace.

## How It Works
The launch files can be used to simulate Misty in Gazebo and Rviz. 
Launch the gazebo file using ```roslaunch misty_description gazebo.launch```
